## What is JSON? 

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a syntax for storing and exchanging data. It is a text, written in JavaScript Object Notation. It is lightweight. JSON basically converts all the objects used in JavaScript (or any language) into text.

* As per Wikipedia, JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit dataobjects consisting of attribute-value pairs and array data types.

* It is a very common data type used in many applications such as Microsoft Azure (where they use JSON defined templates in order to deploy the application in the cloud).
It is also being considered as a replacemnt for XML (Extensible Mark-up Language) in AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) Systems.

* JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript, but many programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON format data. JSON Filenames use the extension - **"file.json"**

## Why JSON? 

JSON is 

* Less Verbose :- JSON has a more compact style than XML, and is often more readable.
The light weight approach of JSON can make significant improvements.

* Fast :- The XML software parsing process can take a ling time. JSON uses less data overall, thus reducing the cost and in turn increases the parsing speed.

* Readable :- The JSON structure is straightforward and readable, thus having easier time mapping to domain objects.

* Structured Data :- JSON uses Map data structure rather than XML's tree based structure. In some situation, key/value pairs limit the functionality, but we end up having a predictable and easy to understand data model.
