TS_Shape_Detect.cpp is for single images.
TS_Shape_Detect_Sequence is for sequence of images.

Both the programs need to be run through the command window.
For TS_Shape_Detect, the command to run is ".exe file argv[1], argv[2], argv[3]".

For TS_Shape Detect_Sequence, the folder needs to be updated in the program file itself.
the command to run is ".exe file argv[1], argv[2]"

Here argv[1] is for the shape. 1 is to detect circle and 2 is to detect rectangle.
argv[2] is for color. Right now 1 is for Red color. and TODO:- 2 is for yellow.
argv[3] is file path for the image.
